## A gentle intro to Python

## What we need for preprocessing: `numpy` and `sklearn`

## Visualizations: Intro to `matplotlib`

For our visualizations, `matplotlib.pyplot` is all we need. Let's import the module and set up figure and axes.
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
```
`plt.subplots()` is a function that returns a tuple containing a figure and axes object(s). `fig` is useful for saving what we have drawn using `ax`. 
Now I draw a sine wave to show how `ax` works.

```python
import numpy as np

t = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)
f = 5
x = np.sin(2 * np.pi * f * t)

ax.plot(t,x)
plt.show() # To display open figures; fig in here
```

After running we see this:

Let's make it prettier using `ax`'s methods:

```python
ax.plot(t, x)
ax.set_title(f'Sine wave with freq={f}')
ax.set_xlabel('Time')
ax.set_ylabel('Signal value')
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

There we go:

## Let's get to the point: `pytorch`

## A little bit of genetic algorithms: `pyeasyga`

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/CI-fall21/CI-fall21.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
